I wanted to embrace the changes and the challenges ahead of me with my family that I've missed so much. I still wonder if I made the right choice. But well, here I am, surviving the city wilderness.">

          title="Auckland	[2002-2006] Find your infinity gauntlet. 
            At age 10, I landed on a small neighborhood of Howick City with literally zero base in English. First day of school, I barely managed to sing the alphabets in the right order. In three months, I learned the survival English hanging on the jungle gym after school. I've also met the most amazing teachers of my life who encouraged me, a little Asian girl, to take challenges seriously. I was an athletic, painter, dancer, writer and everything else I can be. To me New Zealand is a second home that taught me the world could be anything, if I want it to be. I graduated my intermediate school as an over-achiever who would rise up for a round of applaud every single week to receive some sort of awards. Embracing small successes are such a great way to boost your self confidence and the pursuit of learning.">

          title="Los Angeles [2011-2016] Be mindful. 
            I love the city of fallen angel. I love its vintage stores, Taiwanese bubble tea, and rainbow sunsets. So even though my college life is a memory of suffering and hardship, I never regret going to Pomona College. I was mentally insecure going through a series of family financial crisis, especially during my first two years of college. People thought it mysterious how I could still get grades even though I am missing out classes-most of which I slept through because I was not confident enough to face the hardships. It was the friends and faculties that I so dearly admire, who cared and supported me to embrace them all. They taught me that mental issues are neither my faults nor mistakes. It's a part of my weakness that, if taken with care, can actually help me sometimes. For the following years I still went through some ups and downs. But hey, I managed to survive them all. I even graduated with the best thesis of the year. ">

            I managed local guest house and hosted cultural events with an NGO in order to save a town from the destruction of local heritage. What started as a meet up of three foreign volunteers (me and my two French friends) ended up to be a weekly luncheon with 2~3 local residents learning how to cook French-style pancakes. Our guests were happy to share their personal history with us, amazing stories that once you hear them, you would never see those local farmers the same way. They were political leaders, artists and educators who are still open to learn new skills, new languages and new cultures.">
